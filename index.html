        <h2>Fox</h2>

        <p>Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. They
          have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail
          (or
          brush).</p>
        <p>Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25
          current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the
          paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared
          fox,gray fox, and island fox.</p>
        <p>Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red
          fox
          (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of foxes, together with
          their
          widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in
          many
          societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in
          Europe,
          especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.</p>

        <h2>squirrel</h2>

        <p>Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size rodents. The
          squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels (including chipmunks and prairie dogs, among
          others), and flying squirrels. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were
          introduced by humans to Australia.[1] The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene epoch,
          and
          among other living rodent families, the squirrels are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the
          dormice.</p>
        <p>The tiniest squirrel is the aptly named African pygmy squirrel—only five inches long from nose to tail.
          Others reach sizes shocking to those who are only familiar with common tree squirrels. The Indian giant
          squirrel is three feet long.</p>
        <p>Like other rodents, squirrels have four front teeth that never stop growing so they don't wear down from
          the
          constant gnawing. Tree squirrels are the types most commonly recognized, often seen gracefully scampering
          and
          leaping from branch to branch. Other species are ground squirrels that live in burrow or tunnel systems,
          where
          some hibernate during the winter season.</p>

        <h2>Bear</h2>

        <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike
          carnivorans.
          Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of
          habitats
          throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the
          continents
          of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large
          bodies
          with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile
          claws, and short tails.</p>
        <p>While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the
          remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. With the exception of courting individuals and
          mothers
          with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an
          excellent
          sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers.
          Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter
          for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days.</p>

        <h2>Wolf</h2>

        <p>The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native
          to
          Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves,
          as popularly understood, comprise wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the family
          Canidae. It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a
          shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species,
          such
          as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is
          usually
          mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.</p>
        <p>Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as
          demonstrated
          by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced
          expressive
          behaviour including individual or group howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair
          accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity
          and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial and fights over
          territory
          are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild
          hooved mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs
          typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. Pathogens and parasites, notably rabies
          virus, may infect wolves.</p>

        <h2>Monckey</h2>

        <p>There are five different species of baboons. All of them live in Africa or Arabia. Baboons are some of the
          world's largest monkeys, and males of different species average from 33 to 82 pounds. Baboon bodies are 20
          to
          40 inches long, not including substantial tails of varying lengths.</p>
        <p>Baboons generally prefer savanna and other semi-arid habitats, though a few live in tropical forests.</p>
        <p>Like other Old World monkeys, baboons do not have prehensile (gripping) tails. But they can and do climb
          trees to sleep, eat, or look out for trouble. They spend much of their time on the ground.</p>

        <h2>Lion</h2>

        <p>Lion prides can be as small as 3 or as big as 40 animals. In a pride, lions hunt prey, raise cubs, and
          defend
          their territory together. In prides the females do most of the hunting and cub rearing. Usually all the
          lionesses in the pride are related—mothers, daughters, grandmothers, and sisters.</p>
        <p>While the females usually live with the pride for life, the males often stay for only two to four years.
          After that they go off on their own or are evicted by other males who take over the pride. When a new male
          becomes part of the pride it is not unusual for him to kill all the cubs, ensuring that all future cubs will
          have his genes. The main job of males in the pride is defending the pride's territory. A male's loud roar,
          usually heard after sunset, can carry for as far as five miles (eight kilometers). The roar warns off
          intruders and helps round up stray members of the pride.</p>

    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <dl class="faq-list">
      <dt>What baboon monkeys eat?</dt>
      <dd>Baboons are opportunistic eaters and, fond of crops, become destructive pests to many African farmers. They
        eat
        fruits, grasses, seeds, bark, and roots, but also have a taste for meat. They eat birds, rodents, and even the
        young of larger mammals, such as antelopes and sheep.</dd>

      <dt>How many years does a lion live?</dt>
      <dd>So, how long do lions live? In the wild, a lion's average lifespan is about 10-15 years. However, male lions
        typically have a shorter lifespan than lionesses. Males live for 8-12 years while females have a lifespan of
        10-15
        years.</dd>

      <dt>Where the bears live?</dt>
      <dd>Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60
        pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). They're
        found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.</dd>
